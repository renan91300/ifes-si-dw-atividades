00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.000
Life is bigger

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.200
It's bigger

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.600
And you, you are not me

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.100
The lengths that I will go to

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.600
The distance in your eyes

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.700
Oh no, I've said too much

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.400
I set it up

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.000
That's me in the corner

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.100
That's me in the spotlight

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.600
Losing my religion

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.600
Trying to keep up with you

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.200
And I don't know if I can do it

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.600
Oh no I've said too much

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.200
I haven't said enough

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.900
I thought that I heard you laughing

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.300
I thought that I heard you sing

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.800
I think I thought I saw you try

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.600
Every whisper

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.500
Of every waking hour

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.600
I'm choosing my confessions

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.700
Trying to keep an eye on you

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.800
Like a hurt lost and blinded fool

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.100
Oh no, I've said too much

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.100
I set it up

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.200
Consider this

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.900
Consider this

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.700
The hint of the century

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.600
Consider this

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.300
The slip that brought me

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.700
To my knees failed

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.000
What if all these fantasies

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.700
Come flailing around

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.900
Now I've said too much

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.500
I thought that I heard you laughing

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.000
I thought that I heard you sing

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.200
I think I thought I saw you try

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.800
But that was just a dream

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.200
That was just a dream

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.100
That's me in the corner

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.000
That's me in the spotlight

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.600
Losing my religion

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.500
Trying to keep up with you

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.900
And I don't know if I can do it

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.600
Oh no I've said too much

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.100
I haven't said enough

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.800
I thought that I heard you laughing

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.300
I thought that I heard you sing

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:08.500
I think I thought I saw you try

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.900
But that was just a dream,
try, cry, why, try

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.200
That was just a dream, just a
dream, just a dream

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.400
Dream

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:38.400
